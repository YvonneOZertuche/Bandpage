    "summary": "Zooropa was released in 199. The title is a play on the name “Europa” mixed with the “Zoo” theme from the Zoo TV tour. The album was started in February 1993 during a six-month break between legs on the Zoo TV tour. U2 decided they would make an EP to capture some of the energy they had after the tour stopped. The tour was due to restart in May 1993, and they felt an EP would allow them to promote the tour. As work progressed, the band realized they were close to an album, and rather than push out the EP before the start of the tour, they traveled between tour destinations and Dublin to complete mixing and recording of the album.",
